# About me
<div class = "text">
	I was born on the 5th of January, 1982 in Rome. I'm a physicist, father of two children.
Sometimes during the day I become also a computer scientist, a web developer, a web designer, an urbanist.
I'm the creator and webmaster of the <a href = "htttp://www.citychrone.org" target="_blank">CityChrone</a> project.

I'm currently a post-doc researcher at the Politecnico of Turin.
