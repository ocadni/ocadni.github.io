My research interests follow several apparently divergent lines. One is related to the so-called Science of City. In the last years the accumulation of huge amount of data allow nowadays to base on new quantitative studies the research on one of the most complex systems: the urban systems.
Another line of research on the cross-field interaction between statistical physics and complex systems in classical and quantum physics with the optimization algorithm and neural network. Another “divergent” line of research is about visualisation and presentation of the scientific results: why one really has to write a “manuscript” (format invented in late 16th century) to publish scientific results on {{ site.time | date: '%-d %B %Y' }}?

### Science of City.
I focus my research of the last years on studying and quantify the efficency and quality of public transports in urban systems. The results are shown on <a href="www.citychrone.org" target="_blanck">CityChrone</a> platform. 

### Statistical physics, optimizations problems.
I worked for my bachelor and master thesis on statistical mechanics of disorder systems. During my Ph.D I focused my attention on the strong similarity and possible cross-field interaction between stastical physics and optimizations problems in computer science. In particular on the belief propagation algorithms and linear programming to NP-Hard problems.

### Quantum physics, probability distribution approximation.
One of the best algorithms in solving NP-Hard problem are based on belief propagation equations. Belief propagation can be seen as a dinamics of a probability distributions over the configuration of the system under study. The quantum physics is based on the concept of density/wave function and its dynamics. I explored the possible applications of the belief propagation algorithms to the quantum wolrd. Moreover in last years new connections have been made between neural networks and quantum wave functions. The union of this two field could lead to new discover that can potentially change both fields of research.

### Scientific and data visualizations.
I'm involved in finding new and more modern way to understand, share and disseminate the results of scientific research. The scientific works gain their real value only when their are, in some way, absorbed by the society. In this regard applications, website and data visualizations tools that allow people from diffent domains and cultural basis to appreciate the scientific results achieved are fundamental. Moreover this allow to engage people to solve scientific problems, using the power of collective intelligence. I'm developped the CityChrone Platform also with this in mind. On the platform it is possible to construct new public transport scenario and see how its impact the quality of public transport. The goal is to use the intelligence of the citizen to solve a very complicate optimization problem. The citychrone platform is designed also to work on a touch table, allowing collective session.
